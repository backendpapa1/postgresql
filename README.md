## üìå Referencing Tables

```sql
SELECT * FROM actors;
```

Use the table name directly in `FROM` to pull data from that table.

---

## üîÅ Using RETURNING

```sql
INSERT INTO actors (first_name, last_name)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe')
RETURNING id;
```

Returns the inserted row (or specific fields like `id`) immediately after insertion.

---

## üì• Multiple Inserts

```sql
INSERT INTO genres (name)
VALUES ('Action'), ('Drama'), ('Comedy');
```

Insert multiple rows in one go.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Updating Data

```sql
UPDATE movies
SET movie_length = 120
WHERE id = 10;
```

---

## üö´ ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING

```sql
INSERT INTO users (email)
VALUES ('john@example.com')
ON CONFLICT (email) DO NOTHING;
```

Avoids inserting duplicates based on a unique constraint.

---

## üîó String Concatenation (`||`)

```sql
SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name FROM actors;
```

---

## üè∑ Using `AS` for Aliases

```sql
SELECT 2 * 3 AS "multiply";
```

Aliases can name expressions or columns.

‚úÖ `AS` is optional:

```sql
SELECT 2 * 3 "multiply";
```

---

## üìä Ordering Data

### Using ORDER BY

```sql
SELECT 
  first_name,
  last_name,
  date_of_birth 
FROM actors
ORDER BY 
  1 ASC,  -- first_name
  3 DESC; -- date_of_birth
```

### With Alias

```sql
SELECT 
  first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name
FROM actors
ORDER BY full_name;
```

### With Function

```sql
SELECT first_name FROM actors
ORDER BY LENGTH(first_name);
```

---

## üìâ Ordering with NULLs

```sql
SELECT num FROM demo_sorting
ORDER BY num NULLS FIRST;

SELECT num FROM demo_sorting
ORDER BY num DESC NULLS FIRST;
```

---

## üîç DISTINCT Values

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT movie_lang FROM movies;
```

Combine for uniqueness:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT movie_lang, director_id
FROM movies
ORDER BY 1;
```

---

## üîé Filtering with WHERE

### Comparison & Logical Operators

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies 
WHERE (movie_length < 100) AND (age_certificate = 'U')
ORDER BY release_date ASC;
```

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * 
FROM movies 
WHERE (movie_length < 100) 
  OR (age_certificate = 'U' AND movie_lang = 'English') 
ORDER BY age_certificate ASC;
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Execution Order

`AND` is evaluated before `OR`. Use parentheses to clarify logic.

> ‚ùó Aliases can't be used in WHERE
> üß† SQL Order:
> **FROM ‚Üí WHERE ‚Üí SELECT ‚Üí ORDER BY**

---

## üîΩ LIMIT and FETCH

### Using LIMIT

```sql
SELECT * FROM directors
WHERE nationality = 'American'
ORDER BY date_of_birth ASC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Using FETCH

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies
ORDER BY movie_length DESC
FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;
```

### OFFSET with FETCH

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies
ORDER BY movie_length DESC
OFFSET 5 ROWS
FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY;
```

---

## ‚úÖ IN and NOT IN

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE movie_lang NOT IN ('English', 'Chinese');
```

---

## üî¢ BETWEEN and NOT BETWEEN

```sql
SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE movie_length NOT BETWEEN 100 AND 120
ORDER BY movie_length;
```

---

## üß¨ Pattern Matching with LIKE & ILIKE

### LIKE Examples

```sql
SELECT 'hello' LIKE 'hello';     -- true
SELECT 'hello' LIKE '%ell%';     -- true
SELECT 'hello' LIKE '__llo';     -- true
SELECT 'hello' LIKE '%ll_';      -- true
```

### LIKE with Table Data

```sql
SELECT * FROM actors
WHERE first_name LIKE 'A___' -- Names starting with A and 3 characters after
ORDER BY first_name ASC;
```

### ILIKE (Case-Insensitive)

```sql
SELECT * FROM actors
WHERE first_name ILIKE 'a%';
```
